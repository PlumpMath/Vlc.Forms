<h1>Xamarin.Vlc</h1>
Here you can find my sample of how to use VLC as a video player for your xamarin project without installing VLC from the store

<h2>What can you participate with?</h2>

  as a start I think the best thing is to clone this repository and try to build the code to make it running on your android device . Then you can test it and contribute with it . 
IF you are good with binding native libraries and with android studio then a very great thing is to create a dll from the latest VLCLib
You can find their opensource project here 
https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-android/tree/master

<h2>Known Issues </h2>
- The app works if debug the app with a real device only , but if you tried to use emulators it will just crash .
- The dll produced for vlcLib is not from the latests 

_Note : I am still a beginner using the github so if you have any suggestions regarding administrating it please feel free to so_ :)
